Trovu's first version, named Serchilo, registered its domain on May 20, 2005. This will be 20 years ago tomorrow, on Tuesday. ðŸŽ‰

I decided to celebrate this with a [Gather.town](https://www.gather.town/) gathering open to everyone interested.

Gather.town is like a combination of a Zoom call and a 2D avatar game. You only need a browser; just click [the link](http://trovu.net/20years), and you will arrive in a 2D room. You can walk around, and when you come close to others, a video chat will open.

Come and share your user story with me and others, or ask me anything about Trovu's future or past. I look forward to meeting you!
